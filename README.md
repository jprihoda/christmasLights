Arduino library for TLC59731 LED driver

Small easy library for TI TLC59731 LED driver. Used with Arduino Nano v3.0 at 8 MHz. 
For different versions of Arduino there could be need to modify timing, which is crucial for TLC.
I'm not using any low level instructions, just pure Arduino code. 
There is one limitation: I was unable to make it work with certain PINs, but it could be problem for my piece only.
